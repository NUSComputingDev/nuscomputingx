  Citizens of SoC, hope you have been enjoying your holidays! Don't be fooled by this period of tranquility, the calm always hides the storm. Brace yourselves for the upcoming SoC Sports Camp 2018\: Camp SALVOS!

  The elders shall initiate SALVOS on the auspicious 8th January 2018 and end on the 10th. Gear up to prove your worth and prepare for your survival skills to be tested.

  As instructed by the elders, the factions shall compete in a series of events. Scale walls and clear obstacles with our Abseiling, Rock Climbing and Confidence Challenge Rope Course, fight it out in a death match of Laser Tag, zoom to your destination during Night Cycling and pit it out in a strategic game of Capture the Flag!

  It is wisely advised that the best of each faction sign up with their comrades now by simply thinking of a unique and creative identity code and hashtag it when prompted on our sign-up sheet. Participants of compatible personalities and skill sets will be grouped together for the best game outcome. Likewise, do not worry about signing up on your own! We will put you with like-minded individuals as you forge friendships and find comrades to walk through and survive the next harvest year.

  What are you waiting for? Get ready for the most important times of your lives this Winter Break and sign up now at [tiny.cc/gocampsalvos2018](tiny.cc/gocampsalvos2018)!!! May the best faction win.
